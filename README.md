## Improvements
With more time, I culd have clean my code more, provide a cleaner architecture MVC pattern. In addition, I would have create functions to avoid repetition of code and provide code reusability. Also, I would have improved the User Interface and Experience with more details, interactivity and animations. I would have liked to provide Unit Testing too.

I chose to do the entire project programmatically in order to challenge myself to do an alternative coding style. This required more time and effort and I did not get to clean my code as I wished. I also believe by doing everything programmatically, I had more flexibility is style and laying out my views.
